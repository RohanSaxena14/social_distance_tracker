# social_distance_tracker
 In this project we will detect peoples who are not maintaining a social distance in a video frame.
 The main code is in "social_distance_tracker.py" and i have also included colab file with same code "social_distance_tracker.ipynb".
 
 ### We have used yolov3 in openCV for detecting peoples. The coco dataset has 80 categories.
